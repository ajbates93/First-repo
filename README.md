First-repo
==========

My first repo to test the waters. 

My name is Alex Bates. I'm a 21 year old university graduate from Harrogate, England. I studied Music and Recording at the University of Salford, Manchester and graduated July 2014 with a 2:1. I enjoy most things musical and have developed a keen interest in computing and IT over the last few years. I came across GitHub after watching a Shawn Wildermuth presentation on the IT training platform Pluralsight.
